TERMS, CONDITIONS OF USE AND PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR WATCHDOG

The Watchdog system is a free system, and by installing this script, you agree to all of the terms and conditions, including holding Customer Paradigm harmless for any and all delays in alert emails, error warnings or other alerts; as well as any conflicts with your Magento site.  

If you do not agree to ALL of the terms of this agreement, please uninstall this extension.

Customer Paradigm designed the Watchdog system to be an easy-to-install system, and one of the greatest hurdles in user adoption is adding a cron setting to the server in order to have the Watchdog system generate alerts and notifications.  In addition, if a site becomes non-responsive, it's important to rely on an external server to handle the error generation and reporting.

Privacy Promise:
Customer Paradigm is a company dedicated to helping businesses develop customer-centric business practices that encourage trust. We take privacy very seriously, and we’ve taken many steps to help safeguard your online information. We promise you that:

* We will safeguard any information you share with us.
* We will not share information you provide us without your permission.
* We will not send unsolicited e-mails.
* You can unsubscribe from our email mailing list at any time.

We continuously assess ourselves to ensure that your privacy is respected. Please read our Privacy Policy below for more information.

Privacy Policy:
Information We Collect and Store.
When you install and configure Watchdog, you enter in your master email contacts.  The Watchdog system sends these email addresses and the name and URL of your eCommerce store to Customer Paradigm's Watchdog server.

We will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you unless you decide to provide the information to us by installing the Watchdog system. You are not required to provide this information, however the services we can offer you may be limited without it. 

We use this information solely as required to respond to your particular request and to improve both the usability of our site and our user support procedures. The Customer Paradigm Watchdog server also automatically logs visitors’ IP addresses and Internet Service Providers ("ISPs"); and may record information to help prevent the misuse of our system.

How We Use Your Information.
Every five minutes, the Watchdog server initiates a simple request to your system, that triggers the system to send email alerts to you.  The Watchdog alert emails are sent from your server to you directly, and we do not capture the error information.

In the unlikely event that your server is non-responsive, and generates a 200-level error code, the Watchdog server will send an alert from the Watchdog system to the master email addresses informing you of the error.

Consent:
At Customer Paradigm, we believe that our visitors own their personal information. We will always give our registrants a choice regarding how the personally identifiable information they provide us may be used. Our registrants will always have the opportunity to opt in or out of any data collection or distribution.


Disclosure:
Customer Paradigm will not willfully share the personally-identifiable information collected from our visitors (i.e. registrants) without their consent. The only exception to this policy is when we are required to do so by a legal statute, a law enforcement agency, or regulatory authority. This will usually be done only after we receive a court order or subpoena that requires us to release information.

In certain cases, an emergency request from a verifiable law enforcement agency may be honored prior to receiving a court order or subpoena. We will make every reasonable effort to notify our registrants as soon as possible if we receive a request for the release of information so that our registrants can have the opportunity to pursue any legal rights and remedies they may have under the law.

Under certain circumstances, a court order or law may prohibit us from notifying our registrants of a request for information. Examples of this include cases in which fraud and/or criminal activity is suspected. In these cases, we will make every effort to notify our registrant, at the earliest possible time permissible under the law.

Customer Paradigm occasionally sends outbound administrative email communications to ensure that our registrants are aware of significant updates or changes to the Watchdog system, or Customer Paradigm's services. We encourage you to allow us to send this information to you so that you will always be aware of the latest information about Customer Paradigm.

We respect your right not to receive any email that you have not specifically agreed to receive and, in furtherance of this right, have put policies in place that allow our registrants to control the delivery of these messages, or to prevent delivery if that is your preference.

In some cases Customer Paradigm must send administrative emails to our registrants to alert them to specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of their email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding.

Customer Paradigm reserves the right to change its privacy policy to reflect new services that help further establish innovative customer-centric products and services. Notifications of changes to our privacy policy will occur by posting of a message on Customer Paradigm web site at www.CustomerParadigm.com or by users voluntarily viewing the privacy policy for periodic changes. In addition, the Privacy Policy link will always contain the most up-to-date Policy so that our registrants will always have the most current information about our disclosure principles regarding their data and about how Customer Paradigm will manage registrant information.


Data Security:
At Customer Paradigm, we employ security techniques and well-defined employee practices to ensure that data is protected from unauthorized access and use. We hold our employees accountable for maintaining the privacy and integrity of our registrants’ information. We provide ongoing training programs that are designed to keep our employees informed of our Privacy Principles.

Access to Your Information:
For security reasons, we do not provide end users of the Watchdog system access to update your information in our system.  However, you can contact Customer Paradigm via the phone (303.473.4400) or the website (http://www.CustomerParadigm.com) and we will remove this information for you.

Children’s Policy:
At Customer Paradigm, we believe that parents own their children’s personal data. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. In the event Customer Paradigm learns that a registrant is under age 13, we will take steps to ensure that that registrant’s information is deleted from our database. We encourage parents to actively participate in their children’s activities on the Internet and to educate children on the safe use of this exciting medium.

Accountability:
Customer Paradigm takes our responsibility to manage your information and protect your privacy very seriously. We have made the commitment to have our Privacy Policies and Practices audited by independent organizations.
Because we are committed to your privacy and value your trust, this site has agreed to notify you of the following:
1. What personally identifiable information of yours is collected
2. What organization is collecting the information
3. How the information is used
4. With whom the information may be shared
5. What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use, and distribution of the information
6. What type of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company’s control
7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this site’s privacy statement, please Jeff Finkelstein 303.473.4400.
